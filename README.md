Project Title: Differential Expression Analysis with DESeq2 on the Airway Dataset

Description: This project utilizes the DESeq2 package in R for differential expression
analysis on the Airway dataset. It includes custom MA plots and volcano plots for
visualization of the results. Top 10 differentially expressed genes are identified, and
expression of specific genes of interest is explored for deeper insights into the dataset.
This project serves as a demonstration of RNA-seq data analysis using DESeq2 and provides
valuable insights into gene expression changes in the airway dataset.

Key Features:
1) Utilizes DESeq2 for RNA-seq data analysis.
2) Custom MA plots and volcano plots for visualization.
3) Identification of top 10 differentially expressed genes.
4) Exploration of expression patterns for specific genes of interest.

Tools Used: R, DESeq2 package, airway dataset, ggplot2, biomaRt package.
